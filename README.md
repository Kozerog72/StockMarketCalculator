Trading in the financial market has its own risks for a trader if he does not understand "Money Management".
What is Money Management?
This is such a management of the account balance and investment portfolio so that the movement of the price of the invested assets would not affect the premature closing of an open position, due to margin risk, if the price goes to the wrong side, where, under an agreement with brokerage companies, companies reserve, to close the open position of the trader unilaterally, if it seems to them that the open position of the trader has crossed their "red zone", signed in the agreement by the trader!
Therefore, the trader is obliged to maintain the account balance before opening a new position, so that he has enough funds in his account so that his positions are not closed prematurely, before his expectations are fulfilled!
And this calculator is a trader's assistant in terms of risk, which was described above.
In all trading platforms, there are indicators that inform the trader - how much money will be required to open a particular position, depending on the amount of the transaction and its base price. But none of these trading platforms have what is shown on this calculator that would show the general picture of his account before opening a new position.
And I can say this with confidence, since I am familiar with most of the widespread trading platforms...
Just take a look at the attached picture of this post and judge for yourself if you are an active trader...
If you have open position and you want to open new position on the same Ticker, so the calculator will calculate the new average asset price, depending on the amount of the previous and last transactions, which can serve as a guideline at what price you would like to fix profit or loss based on your account balance...
